Day 1: Introduction + Basic

C:/Users/Dell/Doc
//////you gotta save before running////
AUTO SAVE

1, cd <filename> - changedirectory
2, cd .. - getout
3, *tab* - auto fill, tab more to change to other
4, *^ or v* - go to previous or next line or command
5, mkdir <folder name> - make a new folder
6, dir - list all existed file
7, cls - clears crn (but still keep all previous command)
8, exit() - out of IM
9, <file>.upper() - all caps
10, <file>.lower() - all dr1=own
11, print(type( <file>)) - identify file type
12, for i in range(<number>):
      for i in [<list of number>] - loops

fixed hard code -> code which already know how (the second one only depends on the number of members, if use |print(i)| it will print out exact the given numbers)

sript mode >< interactive mode

SYNTAX = grammar error
VALUE = unexpected 
TYPE = different bg

Check TURTLE :0

13, from turtle import *
14, color("<color>")
      begin_fill()
      end_fill()

DAY 2

15, underscore: lowercase all (user_score)
16, range(a, b, c) -> start = a, stop = b, step = c ( if not given, auto a = 0, c = 1)
=> will stop before b 
17, print(*<range>) -> will print out all the number respectively
18, += = add up
19, sum(range(<number>)) - the sum only works with a list of number 
20, if ___ :
	<do smth>
      elif __:
	<do another>
      else:
	<do another smth>
you know what i shouldnt have opened my mouth at all
21, from random import randint - random integer
22, from math import * - take all from math library
