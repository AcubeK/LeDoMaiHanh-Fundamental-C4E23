Day 1: Introduction + Basic

C:/Users/Dell/Doc
//////you gotta save before running////
AUTO SAVE

1, cd <filename> - changedirectory
2, cd .. - getout
3, *tab* - auto fill, tab more to change to other
4, *^ or v* - go to previous or next line or command
5, mkdir <folder name> - make a new folder
6, dir - list all existed file
7, cls - clears crn (but still keep all previous command)
8, exit() - out of IM
9, <file>.upper() - all caps
10, <file>.lower() - all dr1=own
11, print(type( <file>)) - identify file type
12, for i in range(<number>):
      for i in [<list of number>] - loops

fixed hard code -> code which already know how (the second one only depends on the number of members, if use |print(i)| it will print out exact the given numbers)

sript mode >< interactive mode

SYNTAX = grammar error
VALUE = unexpected 
TYPE = different bg

Check TURTLE :0

13, from turtle import *
14, color('<line color>, <bucket color>')
      begin_fill()
      end_fill()

vvvvvvvvvvvvvv
DAY 2

15, underscore: lowercase all (user_score)
16, range(a, b, c) -> start = a, stop = b, step = c ( if not given, auto a = 0, c = 1)
=> will stop before b 
17, print(*<range>) -> will print out all the number respectively
18, += = add up
19, sum(range(<number>)) - the sum only works with a list of number 
20, if ___ :
	<do smth>
      elif __:
	<do another>
      else:
	<do another smth>
you know what i shouldnt have opened my mouth at all
21, from random import randint - random integer
22, from math import * - take all from math library

vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
DAY 3

*in Interactive mode*
BOOLEAN
23, .isdigit() - all number in string
24, .isupper() / islower() - all uppercase or all lower case in string
25, .isalpha - all letters in string
26, if not True == if False
27, Ctrl + C - interrupt
 ***you have to Ctrl +C while in the loops to make the changes***.

i crave death so so so much
28, break - exit loops
C(reate) R(ead) U(pdate) D(elete)
29, Ctrl +/ - comment/uncomment multiple blocks of code
30, <list name>.append(<item>) - add 
31, <list name> = [<list item1>, ..., <list itemn>]
32, print(*<...>, sep = ", ") - print all seperated by ,
33, sep = "\n " - separated by new lines
34, <list name>.pop(position) - delete
35, <list name>.remove("<item name>")
36, for (<counter>, <item>) in enumerate([<list>]):
#ask if i can jump to a specific line in file

37, list(<..>) - list all characters in <..>

vvvvvvvvv
DAY 4
_i didnt save, did i ._. _

42, <list>.index(<item>) - the index of needed item in list
