1, Why should we use function?
    - To shorten the programming time 
    - Due to the complexity of the definitions and repetitive coding

2, How to define a function?
    - For future uses, contain the function in a separate file
    - Use def to declare the function and type a function name, add variables if needed,
    end the line with a colon
    - Add commands that the function should execute
    - Return the variables if needed
3, How to call, use a function?
    - To call and use a function, simply use 
        from #file contained the function# import #function#
        #function(variables)#

4, What is return? How and why we use it?
    - When a function ends, all of variables created within the function will also ceased
    to exist , or in another word, return to None
    - return statement will be used then to bring the variables out of the function 
    as outputs to process in later coding
    - To use: 
        def ...:
            ...
            return #any variables able in the function#

    Then you need to create a container for the outputs.

5, Do we have to use return in every functions?
    - No. As previously stated, we only use return if we need the outputs.

6, What are function arguments/parameters? How and why we use it?
    - Parameters are the names used when defining a function or a method, and into which 
    arguments will be mapped. 
    - In short, arguments are the variables used in the name of the functions and parameters 
    are the variables used in the body of function
    
    As in a function(1), you can also call another function(2) within it, so then the arguement
    of function(2) will become a parameter
    - You should use it to ease the process and your life
    - Really, why, they're in the definition of function

7, How to use function from a different file other than our currently working file?
    - Refered in Q3
